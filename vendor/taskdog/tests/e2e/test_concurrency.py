"""E2E: concurrent writes stay consistent through the real server + SQLite.

Taskdog is used de-facto multi-writer (one person driving several AI agents at
once), so these lock in the contract that concurrent HTTP writes neither error
nor lose/corrupt data. It holds today because the engine runs SQLite in WAL mode
with a 30s busy_timeout (see engine_factory.py); these tests would fail if that
serialization guarantee regressed.

Each thread uses its own TaskdogApiClient because a client wraps a single
httpx.Client that must not be shared across threads.
